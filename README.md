# jogo-adivinhe-o-numero

It is a guess game with voice recognition.

To play it you have to change the settings to allow the use of microphone throw the browser.

The code was made with an API the works on Chrome, Edge and some other browsers, but the documentation says that Firefox is not compatible with this API. Then I haven't tired yet in Firefox.

You have to guess a secret number and say it in microphone in portuguese. However, you can see the secret number stored by entering the inspection and opening the console.
